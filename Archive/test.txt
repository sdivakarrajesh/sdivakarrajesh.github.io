Notable Works on Android
E-SlamBook
What the App does?
> A small android app that performs just what a traditional slambook allows a person to do
> To share moments, favorites, among collegues and friends at school

Key takeaway from the App
> Does not require for us to maintain a server. The app relies on the person's google account.
> Uses Google's Drive and Sheets API to allow for the sharing of data between the users
> Authentication using Google+ API

What I learnt
> How to make use of external API-s offered by other services and organization
> How to read through documentation to make use of the API
> How to integrate third party APIs to provide authentication for the users

Key moments in the App
> The user signs into the App using Google sign-in
> Grants permission to access Google Drive and Sheets
> With a template of questions the app uploads a spreadsheet to the user's Drive and provides a link (to record responses that is to be shared to the other receipient)
> The user shares the link to the receipient
> Using that link the receipient provides his responses for the questions and appends to the sheet on the sender's Sheet 


Sheet2List
What the App does?
> Makes a searchable list from spreadsheet

Key takeaway from the App
> For scenarios like Manager looking up for student's info or a Manager looking for employee's info the app creates a searchable list view of entries
> Instead of bogging through a spreadsheet and getting lost while looking-up clicking on a list item provides the info a separate page
> Provides the ability to call and email while viewing the details - using Implicit Intent to respective services
> Uses Apache POI library to parse data from .xls, .xlsx

What I learnt
> How to use and integrate third party libraries into an android app
> Should take into account all the edge cases while trying to parse and present the details :-P

Key moments in the App
> The user feed a spreadsheet to the app
> The app creates and populates a list with the details in the spreadsheet
> The user can click and view details of a particular entry and perform actions
